#  Travel through games! 

In Roblox, the "universe" refers to a collection of games and places created by users. A "game" is a specific experience within the Roblox platform, while a "place" is a specific instance or version of a game.

Think of the universe as a broader category that encompasses various games. Each game can have multiple places, which are essentially different instances or versions of that game. This structure allows users to create and explore diverse gaming experiences within the Roblox platform.
