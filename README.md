#  Travel through games! 

In Roblox, the "universe" refers to a collection of games and places created by users. A "game" is a specific experience within the Roblox platform, while a "place" is a specific instance or version of a game.

Think of the universe as a broader category that encompasses various games. Each game can have multiple places, which are essentially different instances or versions of that game. This structure allows users to create and explore diverse gaming experiences within the Roblox platform.
Here are some key components and concepts related to universe travel and places in Roblox:

## PlaceId:

Every Roblox game or place is assigned a unique identifier called a PlaceId.
You can find the PlaceId in the URL of the game's page on the Roblox website or in the game settings.
PlaceIds are used with the TeleportService to move players between different places.

## TeleportService:

The TeleportService is a Roblox service that provides functions for teleporting players between places.
The :Teleport method is used to move players to a different place. It takes the target PlaceId and player as parameters.

## Universe:

A universe in Roblox refers to a collection of related games or places.
Games that are part of the same universe can share data and assets, allowing for a cohesive experience across multiple games.

## Teleportation Triggers:

Teleportation can be triggered by various events, such as a player touching a specific part, entering a certain zone, or interacting with an in-game object.
In the provided script, the onTouch function is connected to the Touched event of a specified part, and it triggers teleportation when a player touches that part.

## Cross-Game Communication:

If you have a universe of games, you might want to implement cross-game communication or data sharing. This could involve using services like DataStore or MessagingService to share data between games.
Here's an example of how you might use the TeleportService to teleport a player to a different place within the same game:
